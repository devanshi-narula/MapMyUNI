# MapMyUNI
The MapMyUni project effectively simplifies campus navigation by using Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the
shortest path between locations. By modeling the campus as a weighted graph and offering a user-friendly
interface, the tool enhances route efficiency, saves time, and improves accessibility for students, faculty, and
visitors.
Key benefits include:
• Streamlined Navigation: Quickly locates destinations with accurate routes.
• Time Efficiency: Minimizes travel time by providing optimal paths.
• Enhanced Accessibility: Makes campus exploration easier and more intuitive.
The implementation uses an adjacency list, a min-heap, and a distance table to ensure reliable and efficient
performance. Ongoing feedback will guide future improvements, potentially adding real-time updates and
expanded features.
In summary, MapMyUni is a valuable addition to campus resources, improving navigation and setting the stage
for future enhancements.
